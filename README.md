This point of this repo is for a few members of the [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/) [Center](https://github.com/recursecenter)'s Winter 2 2025 batch (primarily [Suhith](https://github.com/suhithr) and [Nate](https://github.com/nwoods)) to tinker with things as we learn CUDA C++. Don't judge too harshly, we're new to this whole GPU programming thing. If you actually know what's going on, though, and want to give us some friendly pointers, please feel free.
