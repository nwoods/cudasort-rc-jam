This point of this repo is for a few members of the [Recurse](https://www.recurse.com/) [Center](https://github.com/recursecenter)'s Winter 2 2025 batch (primarily [Suhith](https://github.com/suhithr) and [Nate](https://github.com/nwoods)) to tinker with things as we learn CUDA C++. Don't judge too harshly, we used this repo to learn GPU programming from very little starting knowledge.

It can currently do bitonic, radix, and merge sorts, and they're pretty fast. There's no abstraction, encapsulation, etc., because the point was to learn techniques, not write production code.
